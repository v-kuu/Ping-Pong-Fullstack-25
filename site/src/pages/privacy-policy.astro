**Last Updated:** 11.12.2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Pongsite ("we", "us" or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our website and create an account.

We believe in privacy by design. We do not sell your personal data, nor do we collect unnecessary information about you.

## 1. Information We Collect

We only collect information that is strictly necessary to provide our services to you.

### 1.1 Information You Provide to Us
When you create an account, we collect:
* **Account Information:** Your username and/or email address and a password (which is stored securely/hashed).
* **User Content:** The profile picture you voluntarily upload.

### 1.2 Information Collected Automatically
Like most websites, when you access our service, our servers may automatically log standard technical data, including:
* **Log Data:** IP address, browser type, and the time of your visit. This is used solely for security and debugging purposes.
* **Cookies:** We may use essential cookies only to keep you logged in. We do not use third-party tracking cookies or advertising cookies.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information for the following specific purposes:
* To create and maintain your user account.
* To display your profile picture on the service as requested by you.
* To ensure the security of our website (e.g., preventing unauthorized login attempts).

**We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.**

## 3. Data Storage and Security

* **Storage:** Your account information and profile picture are stored on our secure servers located in European Union.
* **Security:** We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain your personal information only for as long as your account is active.
* **If you delete your account:** Your profile picture and personal data are permanently deleted from our active database immediately.

## 5. Your Rights (GDPR and Others)

Depending on your location (including the European Union), you have certain rights regarding your personal data:
* **Access:** You have the right to request a copy of the information we hold about you.
* **Correction:** You have the right to correct inaccurate information.
* **Deletion:** You have the right to delete your account and all associated data at any time directly through the website interface.

## 6. Third-Party Services

We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics) or advertising networks.
